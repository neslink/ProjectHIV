## Project Title: Predicting HIV Progression 

Project Description/Outline: This project involves predicting the likelihood of a reduction in HIV severity for patients based on a limited clinical dataset. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can analyze the available clinical information and forecast the probability of positive outcomes in terms of HIV progression. 

## Research Question(s) to Answer: 

Can machine learning effectively predict the likelihood of reduced severity in HIV patients based on limited clinical information? 

What are the key clinical factors that contribute to predicting positive outcomes in HIV progression? 

## Dataset(s) or API(s) to be Used: 

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hivprogression)

[DATA.GOV](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=hiv&res_format=CSV)

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 

## Data Exploration and Prprocessing:  

Explore and understand the structure of the limited clinical dataset. 

Perform necessary data preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. 

Create a GitHub repository for data exploration and preprocessing. 

## Feature Selection and Engineering:  

Identify key clinical features that may contribute to predicting HIV progression. 

Engineer new features if applicable. 

Document the rationale behind feature selection and engineering. 

## Model Development:  

Implement machine learning models suitable for binary classification (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict HIV progression outcomes. 

Fine-tune and optimize the selected model(s) for better performance. 

Train the model using the provided limited clinical dataset. 

## Evaluation and Model Interpretation:  

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall). 

Interpret the model's predictions and identify influential clinical factors. 

Document insights gained from the model. 

## Web Application Development:  

Design and develop a user-friendly web application for stakeholders to input clinical information and receive predictions. 

Integrate the machine learning model into the web application. 

Create a GitHub repository for the web application. 

## Documentation and medium article:  

Prepare a comprehensive README file with project overview, instructions, and details on the machine learning model. 

Create a presentation showcasing research questions, methodology, model development, and key findings. 

Highlight the importance of clinical features in predicting HIV progression. 

## Project Overview: 

The Predicting HIV Progression project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of reduced severity in HIV patients based on limited clinical information. Additionally, a user-friendly web application will be created to facilitate stakeholder interaction with the model.
